  Really nice to meet me.

  So I'm wondering what this CMS will be like. I like to write clean pages. I like to put content above all

  I like to use code and templates to prettify the things I write.

What I realise now is I have a large body field.

I guess this may be template sensitive

I wonder if I can put an image in the body...

![Wow, that worked](img/wallhung_vs_floorstanding_wc.jpg "An image in the text")

Why, yes I can put an image in the text.

I guess the wrapping settings would be from the display template. At least, that would be logical.
