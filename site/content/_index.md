  text: Because squarespace is OK but I want a template that works well across
    mobile and desktop
intro:
  heading: So what's the problem?
  text: >-
    I like clean content. I think squarespace adds cruft.

    That might be my use of the templates thats doing that, but I need to give this a go.
    
    
    
    I also like the idea that a static site will load much faster... but I could be wrong.

    It might be I deploy from git to my server, and use netlify as a host backup/preview staging site?

    I dunno really.

      So, I can add my images in this template in logical setups.

      That could be cool.

      I'm not sure this image is set to ask for alt text... maybe a template thing.

  heading: Our values
  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
